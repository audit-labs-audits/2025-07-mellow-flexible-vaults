What is the outcome of this submission?\n\nOptions:\n\n A). The report is rejected because the price deviation exceeds the suspicious threshold.\n\nB). The report is accepted but flagged as suspicious, and queues are not processed until it is approved.\n\nC). The report is accepted and processed immediately because it is within the maximum deviation limit.\n\n\nCorrect: C). The report is accepted and processed immediately because it is within the maximum deviation limit.\n\nExplanation: The new price of `106e18` represents a 6% relative deviation from the previous price of `100e18`. This is greater than the `suspiciousRelativeDeviationD18` (5%) but less than the `maxRelativeDeviationD18` (10%). Therefore, the oracle accepts the report but flags it as suspicious. A suspicious report prevents the automatic processing of deposits and redemptions until a privileged account with `ACCEPT_REPORT_ROLE` manually approves it.",
