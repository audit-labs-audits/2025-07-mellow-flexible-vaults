To make the `FactoryStorage` struct data immutable after the factory is constructed.\n\n\nCorrect: A). To enable multiple, independent `Factory` instances to be deployed as proxies, each with its own non-colliding storage.\n\nExplanation: This pattern allows each factory, when deployed as a proxy, to have its own distinct storage space. The `_factoryStorageSlot` is calculated uniquely for each factory instance in its constructor, preventing storage collisions if multiple factories are managed by another contract. While there might be gas implications, the main driver is architectural separation of state.
